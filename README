Set Operations Example
By: Seth Bane

This program is a basic example of some set operations performed on finite sets
that are part of the same universal set.

Also, this program demonstrates the use of the STL vector container

Programmed and Compiled in Visual Studio 2008 Professional

Works in Progress:
      - Code is not usable with vectors that have different sizes
      - I am sure there are better ways to optimize the code
        But, I opted to use the Brute-force approach
